--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string as a parameter and prints its words in sorted
order by length first and then by alphabetical order on each line:
When we say alphabetical order, we ignore the case of letters.

For example aA and Aa are the same but the  original order must remain
(lower and upper case are the same in alphabetical order). If there are
duplicates, they must remain.

If number of parameters is different from 1, the program prints 
\n.

There will be only spaces, tabs and alphanumeric characters in strings.

You'll print only one space between each word. Nothing before the first and 
after the last word of each line.

Examples:

$>./ord_alphlong
$
$>./ord_alphlong "After all this time Always said Snape" | cat -e
all$
said this time$
After Snape$
Always$
$>./ord_alphlong "A a b B cc ca cd" | cat -e
A a b B$
ca cc cd$
$>./ord_alphlong "Never take a gamble you are not prepared to lose" | cat -e
a$
to$
are not you$
lose take$
Never$
gamble$
prepared$
$>
