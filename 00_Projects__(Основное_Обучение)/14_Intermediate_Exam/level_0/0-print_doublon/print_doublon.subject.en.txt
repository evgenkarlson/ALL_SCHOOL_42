ALERT: OPTIMIZED SOLUTION REQUIRED.

Given two sorted arrays passed as parameters,
create a function able to print all the number that are present
in one array and in the other, separated by a space.
Then print a new line.

The function must be declared as follows (with 'na' the length of the array 'a',
and 'nb' the length of the array 'b'):

void	print_doublon(int *a, int na, int *b, int nb);

Considerations:

- Be careful: the naive solution won't work on our big input, you have to
find an optimized solution which will run in O(n) time (where n is
the length of the longest array between a and b).
- All elements of an array are unique. The same number will not repeat in an array. 
- If there is no doublon, just print a new line '\n'.
- The largest test we will run will be on two arrays of 500,000 elements each,
it should run in less than 2 seconds.

Example 1:

a = [ 1,  2, 10, 15 ] , na = 4
b = [ 2, 20, 40, 70 ] , nb = 4

In this case, by using a main file that use your function with the above input,
the output should be (using cat -e):

$> ./example1 | cat -e
2$

Example 2: 

a = [ -5,  2, 10, 15, 50, 70, 100, 200, 300, 1200, 5000 ] , na = 11
b = [  2,  4,  5,  6,  7, 10,  40,  70 ]                  , nb = 8 

In this case, by using a main file that use your function with the above input,
the output should be (using cat -e):

$> ./example2 | cat -e
2 10 70$

Example 3:

a = [ 100,  200, 300 ]    , na = 3
b = [   1,    2,   3, 4 ] , nb = 4

In this case, by using a main file that use your function with the above input,
the output should be (using cat -e):

$> ./example3 | cat -e
$
