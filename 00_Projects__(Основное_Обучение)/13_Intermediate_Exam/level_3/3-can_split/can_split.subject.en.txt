ALERT: OPTIMIZED SOLUTION REQUIRED.

Given the root node of a binary tree, create a function that returns 1 if, by
removing one edge of the tree, it can be split into two trees with the same
number of nodes (i.e with the same 'size'). 

The binary tree uses the following node structure :

struct s_node 
{
	int value;
	struct s_node *left;
	struct s_node *right;
};

The function must be declared as follows:

int	can_split(struct s_node *n);

Consideration:

- Be careful: the naive solution won't work on our big input, you have to find
an optimized solution which will run in O(N) time (where N is the number of nodes).
- The largest test we wil run is about 250 000 nodes. It should run in less
than 2 seconds.

Example 1:

       28
       /
      51
     / \
    /   \
   26   48
  / \
 /   \
76   13

In this case, it should return 1 (remove the edge between 51 and 26 will split the tree
in 2 trees with each a size of 3).


Example 2: 

    30
    / \
   /   \
  15   41
 /     /
61    80

In this case, it should return 0 (you can't split the tree and make 2 trees with the
same size).


Example 3:

10
  \
   12

In this case, your function return 1.


Example 4:

   5
  / \
 /   \
1     6    
    /  \
   7    4
 /  \    \
3    2    8

In this case, your function should return 0.
