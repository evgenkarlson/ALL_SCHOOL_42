# Introduction #

This repository contains ALL the TASKS and the PROJECTS in the training program from the [french programming school `Ecole 42`](https://www.42.fr/).

Projects and assignments will allow you to independently develop your programming skills, and the practical experience and knowledge gained while completing assignments and projects of School 42 will give you the necessary basis for professional integration, helping you to get a demanded profession from scratch.

By sequentially moving through the directions, languages ​​and educational projects of School 42, using [the `Holy Graph` projects map](https://github.com/evgenkarlson/Subjects___School_42/blob/master/00_Projects__(%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5)/Holy_Graph.png), you will develop fundamental technical skills:

- System programming skills.
- Knowing and understanding the essence of operating systems, networks, clouds and the services they contain.
- Systems and network administration skills.
- Information security skills.
- AI skills.
- Mobile Dev skills.
- Graphics skills.
- WEB development skills.
- Network skills.
- DB and Data.
- etc.

The School's 42 curriculum is individualized. Here, everyone progresses on their own, at their own pace, rather than according to the entire class of students (where the latest element of group slows down work of the entire group), thus gaining their own understanding of programming paradigms.
 


# 0. School Documentation #

Here you can familiarize yourself with the rules in force within the walls of School 42, learn about the curriculum itself, read about the standards by which you will need to write code when solving tasks and projects, and also see everything that will help you start learning programming according to the program Schools 42.

# 1. Piscine C #

It is from this place that the teaching of programming in School 42 will begin.
- `Piscine` by language `C`: [[ en ]](https://github.com/evgenkarlson/ALL___Subjects___School_42/tree/master/00_Piscine_C_(%D0%98%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%8B%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%91%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD_%D0%A8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8B))
- Exam tasks of the `Piscine` by language `C`: [[ en ][ fr ][ ro ]](https://github.com/evgenkarlson/ALL___Subjects___School_42/tree/master/00_Piscine_C_(%D0%98%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%8B%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%91%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD_%D0%A8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8B)/Exam_C)
- Ready-made and commented solutions for `Piscine` by language `C`: [[ ru ][ en ]](https://github.com/evgenkarlson/Completed___Piscine_C___of___School_42)

Here you will be fully immersed in a deep part of the code, which will allow you to truly discover the school, its unique teaching method and, above all, what programming really is.

Every day of the pool you will receive a portion of tasks (usually 10 - 25), arranged in increasing difficulty. And every day you will go through a new topic and new features of the language that you will understand and remember while completing the tasks of this day.

To help you understand them, you are provided with training [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnI5O9CyX5MFaOvTB1EWSHFC7EzB61UIp) for 10-30 minutes with theory and examples (use the function of subtitles in the player and their translation into the language you need), but, as a rule, this will never be enough. Therefore, you are looking for all the necessary information for training yourself via the Internet.. 

From the very first day, you are faced not only with difficult tasks, but with whole areas of knowledge, the existence of which you might not even know. Thus, no matter how high your starting level is, you will surely come across a task that will definitely cause difficulties. Seeing him, you will first go into a stupor, but then, through incredible efforts, making a series of mistakes, you still cope with the task and acquire a skill that becomes a familiar tool. The `Piscine` by lanuage `C` will be a test of endurance for those who decide to start the programming path to determine the most motivated.

> #### (!) Do not be a fool and do not rush to move on to main training until you have passed and fully assimilated the material `Piscine` by language `C`.

All of them are grouped by directions, which are represented as branches. Remember that each subsequent project of your chosen branch is more difficult than the previous one and can only be solved using the skills acquired in previous projects.
